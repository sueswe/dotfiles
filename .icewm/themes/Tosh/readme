Tosh 0.2 readme file
--------------------



DESCRIPTION:

Tosh is just a Finder-related window decoration for IceWM. I've re-done
all graphics for this nu version.



INSTALLATION:

Copy the contents of this archive in its directory in the KDE IceWM
themes directory.

Usually, this directory should be:
	~/.kde/share/apps/kwin/icewm-themes/

The system-wide directory should be:
	/usr/share/apps/kwin/icewm-themes/

When files copied, open the KDE Control Center, select Look & Feel,
then select Window Decoration. In the General tag, select IceWM as your
default window style. In the Configure IceWM tag, select Tosh as your
IceWM theme.



CHANGELOG:

0.2	Buttons are now more Mac-like
	Inactive window appearance is now more Mac-like
	Window borders improved (no black lines)
	Menu button disappeared
	Button locations changed



SUGGESTIONS:

I use this style with the Light Style 2nd revision KDE-style, but I think that
the Qt Platinum style is more MacOS like.

A personal recommendation: if you want to get the best Finder-related view,
just download the Chicago font (or its free alternative, Virtue) then use it in
window titles.



LICENSE:

This IceWM theme is released under the GPL license (version 2 or later), as
published by the FSF.

Graphics contained in this theme are *NOT* the original MacOS graphics, just
made by me!



NOTES:

Now I'm developing a complete Mac theme for the KDE enviroment, including icons,
widgets and window decorations. Check www.kde-look.org for further info.
